full adder design using half adders
Half Adder:

A Half Adder is a combinational circuit that performs binary addition of two single-bit inputs. It produces a Sum and a Carry output.

Full Adder:

A Full Adder extends the functionality of a Half Adder by including an additional Carry input, allowing for multi-bit addition.

ðŸ”¹ Half Adder:

Simple and fast for basic single-bit addition.

Low power and minimal logic gates.

Used in multipliers for partial product generation.

ðŸ”¹ Full Adder:

Handles carry propagation for multi-bit addition.

Scalable for building larger adders (Ripple Carry, Carry Look-Ahead).

Essential in ALUs and arithmetic operations in processors.
